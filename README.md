# ATM-Simulator 


My code assumes the last 6 digits of the card number and the pin must be prime numbers. These 2 prime numbers are multiplied and only the resulting product is stored. When giving input, the code checks if both are prime numbers 


My code assumes all cards from a particular bank must start with 753425. Any other card will be rejected, unless the code is modified.
